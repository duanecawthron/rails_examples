==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, so it was not symlinked into /usr/local.

OS X provides the BSD libedit library, which shadows libreadline.
In order to prevent conflicts when programs look for libreadline we are
defaulting this GNU Readline installation to keg-only.


Generally there are no consequences of this for you.
If you build your own software and it requires this formula, you'll need
to add its lib & include paths to your build variables:

  LDFLAGS: -L/usr/local/Cellar/readline/6.2.1/lib
  CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/Cellar/readline/6.2.1/include

Set up databases to run AS YOUR USER ACCOUNT with:
    unset TMPDIR
    mysql_install_db --verbose --user=`whoami` --basedir="$(brew --prefix mysql)" --datadir=/usr/local/var/mysql --tmpdir=/tmp

To set up base tables in another folder, or use a differnet user to run
mysqld, view the help for mysqld_install_db:
    mysql_install_db --help

and view the MySQL documentation:
  * http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mysql-install-db.html
  * http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/default-privileges.html

To run as, for instance, user "mysql", you may need to `sudo`:
    sudo mysql_install_db ...options...

Start mysqld manually with:
    mysql.server start

    Note: if this fails, you probably forgot to run the first two steps up above

A "/etc/my.cnf" from another install may interfere with a Homebrew-built
server starting up correctly.

To connect:
    mysql -uroot

To launch on startup:
* if this is your first install:
    mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    cp /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.5.10/com.mysql.mysqld.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
    launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mysql.mysqld.plist

* if this is an upgrade and you already have the com.mysql.mysqld.plist loaded:
    launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mysql.mysqld.plist
    cp /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.5.10/com.mysql.mysqld.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
    launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mysql.mysqld.plist

You may also need to edit the plist to use the correct "UserName".

Warning: m4 macros were installed to "share/aclocal".
Homebrew does not append "/usr/local/share/aclocal"
to "/usr/share/aclocal/dirlist". If an autoconf script you use
requires these m4 macros, you'll need to add this path manually.
