Installing RVM to /Users/cawthron/.rvm/~/.rvm ~/.rvm/src/rvm
~/.rvm/src/rvm

    Correct permissions for base binaries in /Users/cawthron/bin...
    Copying manpages into place.

  Notes for Darwin ( Mac OS X )
    For Snow Leopard be sure to have Xcode Tools Version 3.2.1 (1613) or later
    You should download the latest Xcode tools from developer.apple.com.
      (This is since the dvd install for Snow Leopard contained bugs).

    If you intend on installing MacRuby you must install LLVM first.
    If you intend on installing JRuby you must install the JDK.
    If you intend on installing IronRuby you must install Mono (version 2.6 or greater is recommended).

    To seamlessly abandon the Apple-installed system ruby (ruby 1.8.7 patchlevel 174 for Snow Leopard):

    rvm install 1.8.7 # installs patch 302: closest supported version
    rvm system ; rvm gemset export system.gems ; rvm 1.8.7 ; rvm gemset import system # migrate your gems
    rvm --default 1.8.7

  

  You must now complete the install by loading RVM in new shells.

  1) Place the folowing line at the end of your shell's loading files
     (.bashrc or .bash_profile for bash and .zshrc for zsh),
     after all PATH/variable settings:

     [[ -s "/Users/cawthron/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "/Users/cawthron/.rvm/scripts/rvm"  # This loads RVM into a shell session.

     You only need to add this line the first time you install rvm.

  2) Ensure that there is no 'return' from inside the ~/.bashrc file,
     otherwise rvm may be prevented from working properly.

     
  This means that if you see something like:

    '[ -z "$PS1" ] && return'

  then you change this line to:

  if [[ -n "$PS1" ]] ; then

    # ... original content that was below the '&& return' line ...

  fi # <= be sure to close the if at the end of the .bashrc.

  # This is a good place to source rvm v v v
  [[ -s "/Users/cawthron/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "/Users/cawthron/.rvm/scripts/rvm"  # This loads RVM into a shell session.

EOF - This marks the end of the .bashrc file

     Be absolutely *sure* to REMOVE the '&& return'.

     If you wish to DRY up your config you can 'source ~/.bashrc' at the bottom of your .bash_profile.

     Placing all non-interactive (non login) items in the .bashrc,
     including the 'source' line above and any environment settings.

  3) CLOSE THIS SHELL and open a new one in order to use rvm.
  

Installation of RVM to /Users/cawthron/.rvm/ is complete.


cawthron,

Thank you very much for using RVM! I sincerely hope that RVM helps to
make your work both easier and more enjoyable.

If you have any questions, issues and/or ideas for improvement please
join#rvm on irc.freenode.net and let me know, note you must register
(http://bit.ly/5mGjlm) and identify (/msg nickserv <nick> <pass>) to
talk, this prevents spambots from ruining our day.

My irc nickname is 'wayneeseguin' and I hang out in #rvm typically

  ~09:00-17:00EDT and again from ~21:00EDT-~23:00EDT

If I do not respond right away, please hang around after asking your
question, I will respond as soon as I am back.  It is best to talk in
#rvm itself as then other users can help out should I be offline.

Be sure to get head often as rvm development happens fast,
you can do this by running 'rvm get head' followed by 'rvm reload'
or opening a new shell

  w⦿‿⦿t

    ~ Wayne
